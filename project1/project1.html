    <h2>Describe how search engines work</h2>
    <p>Search engines use a programming algorithm to scrape the web and download web pages in order to navigate through the those pages to catalog and discover new pages. The reason we use search engines is to very quickly and effectively gather the most relevant search results to best fit a user's search query as quickly as possible.</p>
    <h2>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags</h2>
    <p>Keywords allow search engine crawlers to catalog web pages by specificity. Meaning instead of saving the entire pages content it only logs keywords used to describe what the content is about. Description meta tags allow a deeper dive into what the site will be about and are generally supposed to house more detail than Title meta tags.</p>
    <h2>List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Technical SEO: How well your site can be crawled and cataloged.</li>
      <li>Content: Having the most relevant and accurate answers to a user's search query.</li>
      <li>On-site SEO: The optimization of your content and HTML with the help of detailed meta tags and keywords.</li>
      <li>Off-site SEO: Building authenticty to ensure search engines like Google stacks the deck in your favor.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with more than one heading tag</h2>
    <p>Including keywords in heading helps to give your site an edge for search engine crawlers and users to better find what they are looking for. Also the proper use of headings so that search engines can properly understand your sites structure. Anything you can do to engage a positive user experience helps.</p>
